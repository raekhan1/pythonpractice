For x in initial list of moles:
	mole = initial moles

	start tree starting from x 

	changed moles = x-1, x+1 , x+4, x-4 
	if any moles in changed moles < 0 delete from changed moles 
	
	for y in changed moles:
		if y is in initial moles :
			delete mole from mole
		else: 
			add mole to mole 

	create second layer of the tree using mole list 
	repeat  line 6-13 for  each node until there are no moles in mole list 
	find shortests route possible using the tree 

Next x 

Compare shortest routes found using different starting points 
Find shortest route
